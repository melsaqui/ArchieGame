# Game Instructions:
Archie (A) must escape the dungeon by collecting all the chips (H) in the map. Throughout the game Archie will need to unlock doors with their corresponding keys. Archie must be able to avoid drowning (water is represented by the'~' symbol) by collecting the water protection powerup (*). Similarly Archie may also burn (fire is represented by '%') thus, the need for fire protection (@). Burning or drowning will lead to losing the game. Archie must also be able to avoid enemies (0) that will throw all Archies items all over the dungeon again. Once All chips have been collected, Archie must be able to exit the dungeon and remember the passcode for the next level. If Archie tries to escape without all the chips they will die, similarly if the wrong passcode is entered thrice then they will also die.
